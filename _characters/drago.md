# Background
Drago is the son of [Count Maurice Pom'l](poml.html) and the late Kira Pom'l. He is well known for his physical prowess and his charasmatic demeanor. He is perhaps the opposite of his father. He can be loud and abrasive and loves getting in a fight.

He is a brilliant investigator and works for the city guard. His latest investigations have been concerning strange sightings in the city. He has taken to drink ever since coming back from the war at the Northern Border. After being imprisoned and obligated to work as a medic for (in his eyes) enemies camp, he soon came to doubt the merit of war.

Seeing children and families struck by the canons of his own people and having to take care of them certainly sucked the meaning ouf of going to war.

Drago was investigating the templars of Zewerda.

An old innkeeper in the town of Purnagan: Krustral Genergin would help him out with his investigation.

Krustral herself was still a devout follower of Feredina.
