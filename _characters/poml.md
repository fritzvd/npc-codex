# Background
Maurice Pom'l is the patron or beneficiary of the adventurers. Born in the days where Gurulam was a great nation he longs for a just king to rule the nation again. He has no aspirations to rule the nation, he just cares to see it do well. 

A slender, slight man, with a deep love for his county and all the creatures there in, big and small. Pom'l has had a relationship with halfling Terianne Mevanbrook ever since his wife Kira (elvish) died in labour giving birth to his son [Dago Pom'l](dago.html). His daughter Arleana was around the age of 3 when Kira died.

He loves going for a walk in his gardens. Being among nature and his people is what sets him in a jovial mood.

He is timid and not a typical ruler. He can seem somewhat vacant and lost in thought.

Kan een flinke spell op menig vijand uitoefenen.
